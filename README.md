# Software Architecture Notes

This repository contains notes and initial reflections on Software Architecture,
based on my studies in Software Engineering.

The goal is to organize fundamental concepts such as:
- the role of software architecture
- architectural decisions
- system quality attributes
- long-term system maintainability

This repository is part of my learning journey in software development and engineering.

Thank you.
